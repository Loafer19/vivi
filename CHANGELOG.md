# Changelog

## [0.3.0] — 2026-10-13
Milestone M4: queue, playlists and resume.

### Highlights
- **Queue** tab in the side panel: everything you open, drop or pass on the command line plays in order.
- **Resume where you left off**, with a "Start over" prompt (Figma "continue" toast).
- **Recent files** on the start screen.

### Added
- Queue: add files (multi-select), drag & drop to append, click to play, reorder, remove, clear; next/prev buttons step through it.
- Playlists: save the queue as `.m3u` in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/vivi/playlists`, load and delete saved playlists.
- Resume: mpv watch-later files in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/vivi/watch_later` (position, tracks, delays, volume, speed), saved every 5 s and on quit.
- Recent: last 8 files on the empty state (stored in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/vivi/recent.txt`), with Clear.

### Known issues
- Queue reordering uses up/down buttons; drag-to-reorder is not implemented.
- The playlist name field still uses Slint's default (light) text input style.
- Drag & drop does not work on Wayland yet (#5).
- Settings and per-show presets are still not saved (M5).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-10-13
Milestone M3: side panel & tracks.

### Highlights
- New right-hand **side panel** (from the Figma "sidebar" frame) with Subtitles, Audio, Video and Playback tabs.
- Subtitles stay visible above the controls.

### Added
- Subtitles: track list from mpv, add external subtitle file, delay, size, position.
- Audio: track list, output device, delay, volume boost up to 150%, EQ presets (Flat, Bass, Treble, Voice, Loudness).
- Video: aspect ratio, rotation, zoom, pan & scan, brightness/contrast/saturation/gamma, hardware decoding toggle.
- Playback: speed presets + slider, A-B loop, sleep timer, chapters, in-memory bookmarks (Ctrl+B).

### Fixed
- Subtitles were hidden behind the bottom bar.
- Empty gaps above lists in the side panel.

### Known issues
- Settings, bookmarks and per-show presets are not saved yet (planned for M5).
- Drag & drop does not work on Wayland yet (#5).

First playable build.

### Added
- Playback via libmpv (OpenGL render API) under a Slint UI (winit + femtovg; Wayland and X11).

- 201 SVG icons extracted from the Figma "VLC Redesign" file.
- Auto-hiding bars and cursor (2 s), title top bar.
